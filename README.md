# TA_Demo_Web_Scraping_II

This webscraping demo uses the following elements:

* a Juypter notebook to explore the code necessary to scrape four Mars related websites using Beautifullsoup

* an HTML file (index.html) to display the scraped information

* a Flask application (app.py) to serve up the HTML file

* a Scraping application (scrape_mars.py) that uses the code developed in the Juypter notebook and scrapes the four websites using four seperate functions and then passes that scraped informaiton to a MongoDB database
